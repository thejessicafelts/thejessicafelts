  <strong>Welcome!</strong> My name is Jessica, and I am a Lead Software Engineer, with over a decade of professional experience. My expertise in Software Engineering and Accessibility Compliance has helped me effectively communicate with stakeholders to fulfill project requirements while maintaining a strong focus on the end user. A firm understanding of multiple languages, libraries, and frameworks, and experience working on multiple platforms, have served me well as I mentor and lead teams from project planning through deployment.
