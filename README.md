  <strong>Welcome!</strong> My name is Jessica Felts, and I am a Senior UI Engineer and Accessibility Advocate with over a decade of experience crafting high-performance, user-centric digital solutions. I specialize in building scalable front-end architectures, optimizing accessibility, and enhancing user experiences across diverse platforms.</p>

<p>With a solid understanding of multiple languages, libraries, and frameworks, combined with extensive experience across various platforms, I excel in mentoring and leading cross-functional teams through every phase of a projectâ€”from planning to deployment and beyond. I am deeply committed to incorporating user accessibility and data privacy principles into every project I undertake, and advocating for appropriate compliance whenever necessary.</p>

<p>While my primary focus is UI Engineering and Accessibility, my skill set spans the full spectrum of Software Engineering, including the full-stack development of applications and e-commerce solutions, as well as Scientific Data Analysis and Data Visualization. This broad technical expertise allows me to communicate effectively with both team members and stakeholders, and is complemented by an academic background not only in Computer Science, but in Neuroscience, and Biomedical Sciences, which further enhances my ability to approach projects with a multidisciplinary perspective.</p>

<p>I am actively seeking senior-level opportunities, where I can lead UI Engineering and Accessibility efforts, mentor teams, and drive innovation through cutting-edge UI Engineering practices.</p>
